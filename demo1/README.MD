# Lesson 5, Demo 1
Demo 1 and Checkpoint 1 is a follow-along setup of Google Firebase and Realtime Database. If you were unable to follow along during the lesson or want to use some text instructions, this file will explain how to do so.

## What is Google Firebase and Realtime Database?
Google Firebase is a development platform run by Google with a variety of features and services. We
will only go over the absolute basics, but other services you may be interested are Google Analytics, Firebase Hosting, and Firebase Authentication.

Realtime Database is a NoSQL database where data is stored in an unstructured JSON object. That means that
all data must be key-value pairs or key-object pairs. It also means the data is easily processed by JavaScript
and the Web Browser.
